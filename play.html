        <h3> Tartuffe </h3>
        <h4>Act IV  SCENE III of the play is the conversation between Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante and Dorine</h4>

        <p>   <h6 class="name"><b>Orgon:</b></h6><p class="Orgon speech"> Keep quiet, and stay out of this matter.
            I completely forbid you to add to the chatter. </p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Cleante:</b></h6><p class="Cleante speech"> If you will allow me to offer some advice . . .</p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Orgon:</b></h6><p class="Orgon speech"> Brother, your advice is worth any price:
            It is thoughtful and I truly respect it,
            But I hope you don't mind if I reject it.</p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Elmire [to her husband]:</b></h6><p class="Elmire speech">  What can I think about what you're saying
            Except that your blindness is quite dismaying!
            You must be besotted and led astray
            To refuse to believe what has happened today.</p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Orgon:</b></h6><p class="Orgon speech">  My dear, I only call 'em as I see 'em.
            You favor my son, that worthless young bum, And I think that you are afraid to condemn His dirty trick on this most saintly of men.
            You are, in fact, too calm to be believed;
            You ought to have seemed a bit more aggrieved.</p> 
        <h6 class="name"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p class="Elmire speech">  When a love-sick man makes a foolish mistake
            Must we take up arms as if honor's at stake? And should we always respond to small slips
            With fire in our eyes and abuse on our lips? For myself, I laugh at these signs of lust;
            It doesn't please me at all to grow nonplussed. I seek wisdom tempered with charity,
            And I'm not one of those prudes whose asperity Is such that they fight for virtue tooth and nail,
            And scratch a man's eyes out for being male. Heaven preserve me from that kind of virtue!
            I am an honest wife, but not a shrew, And I believe that a calm, icy glance
            Is quite enough to rebuff an advance.</p>
            <h6 class="name"><b>Orgon:</b></h6><p class="Orgon speech">I know what I know and I won't change my mind.</p>
       </p>
