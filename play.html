        <h3> Tartuffe </h3>
        <h4>Act IV  SCENE III of the play is the conversation between Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante and Dorine</h4>

        <p>  Orgon. Keep quiet, and stay out of this matter.
                    I completely forbid you to add to the chatter.
            Cleante.  If you will allow me to offer some advice . . .
            Orgon.  Brother, your advice is worth any price:
                    It is thoughtful and I truly respect it,
                    But I hope you don't mind if I reject it.
            Elmire [to her husband].  What can I think about what you're saying
                                    Except that your blindness is quite dismaying!
                                    You must be besotted and led astray
                                    To refuse to believe what has happened today.
            Orgon.  My dear, I only call 'em as I see 'em.
                    You favor my son, that worthless young bum,
                    And I think that you are afraid to condemn
                    His dirty trick on this most saintly of men.
                    You are, in fact, too calm to be believed;
                    You ought to have seemed a bit more aggrieved.
            Elmire.  When a love-sick man makes a foolish mistake
                    Must we take up arms as if honor's at stake?
                    And should we always respond to small slips
                    With fire in our eyes and abuse on our lips?
                    For myself, I laugh at these signs of lust;
                    It doesn't please me at all to grow nonplussed.
                    I seek wisdom tempered with charity,
                    And I'm not one of those prudes whose asperity
                    Is such that they fight for virtue tooth and nail,
                    And scratch a man's eyes out for being male.
                    Heaven preserve me from that kind of virtue!
                    I am an honest wife, but not a shrew,
                    And I believe that a calm, icy glance
                    Is quite enough to rebuff an advance.
            Orgon.  I know what I know and I won't change my mind.
           </p>
